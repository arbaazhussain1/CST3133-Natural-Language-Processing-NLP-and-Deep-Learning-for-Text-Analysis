##  Project Structure

### Part 1: Machine Learning Workflow – Model Development and Ethical Considerations

This section focuses on the complete machine learning development process, covering:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Development**: Training, tuning, and validating machine learning models.
- **Evaluation**: Using appropriate performance metrics to assess model effectiveness.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Addressing bias, fairness, transparency, and societal impact in machine learning applications.

### Part 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning for Text Analysis

This section focuses on applying deep learning techniques to natural language tasks, including:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
- **Word Embeddings**: Using pre-trained embeddings and custom embedding layers.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Building LSTM models for sequence classification tasks.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Predicting the sentiment of text data based on learned models.
